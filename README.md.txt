### DROs

DRO listing is based on initial proposal and deliverable goals - [FAIR Standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HJQkdKp-5E7AAL7ywaLykZ5PyRdDFwffB0Aijainhtc/edit) and previous Git issues, with a primary focus on the key 3 data repositories and the DROs present within.

### Rubrics

Rubrics are based off FAIRsharing-centric terms to have general usability across disciplines/persona use while enabling more specialized information sharing, as well.
